                Whether teaching the challenged learner; a college student; or an adult learning a new language; a deep understanding of the subject and each individual goals will be met. I have created professional productions seen by audiences small and large. I have worked with elementary students on small productions for talent shows. I have worked with dance companies, art's council's and churches embarking on new missions. I believe in creating a learning environment that tackles the challenges head on with mastery.
